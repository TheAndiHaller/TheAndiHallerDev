I might be the best idea killer I know — especially when it comes to my own.

Every time I have a new idea, I immediately find reasons why it’s bad. If I don’t kill it right away, I start building it — and halfway through, I convince myself it’s stupid, pointless, and destined to fail. So I drop it.

Maybe I’m just a great critic. Maybe I really *am* saving myself time, energy, and embarrassment by identifying failures early.

But sometimes I wonder...  
What if I’m not being smart — just scared?  
What if the ideas weren’t bad — and I just didn’t believe in myself enough to finish them?

The truth is, I’ll never really know unless I start shipping in public.  
Let other people decide — with their time, their attention, their wallets.  
I don’t care about opinions. I care about *usefulness*. I care if what I make helps someone.

## So here’s what I’m going to do:

I’m going to stop overthinking and start **building**. Not just one thing — **everything**.  
I’m going to MVP the hell out of every idea I get.

Why not?  
We live in an age where AI tools let us build faster than ever.  
The cost to try is basically time — and I *need* the practice anyway.

Worst case: the MVP flops.  
Cool. I’ve got a new project to show, and I’ve learned something.  
Best case: people love it, and I’ve got something real to grow.

No more perfect ideas.  
No more silent drafts.  
Just fast launches, real feedback, and momentum.

It’s time to try. Publicly.  
I’ll let the world decide.
