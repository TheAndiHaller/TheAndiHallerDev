### Project Description

I had the pleasure of working with **Damaris Catalán**, a personal styling and colorimetry specialist dedicated to empowering professional women through their personal image. The main goal was to design a clean, professional, and approachable website that would reflect her essence and clearly communicate the value of her services.

### What I did

- Designed and developed an **optimized landing page** that clearly and persuasively communicates her value proposition.  
- Applied a clean and feminine aesthetic, with a soft color palette and vibrant accents to highlight key elements.  
- Created dynamic sections to showcase **real client testimonials**, **video content**, and a gallery of **before-and-after transformations**.  
- Built a clear system for selecting between her **programs and services**, with detailed descriptions and strong calls to action.  
- Fully responsive and mobile-optimized experience across all devices.

### A very positive experience

Working with Damaris was truly enriching. From the beginning, there was a genuine connection with her vision and passion for helping women express their inner power. The process was collaborative, smooth, and full of great ideas.

I loved turning her energy and professionalism into a website that not only informs but also inspires.  
This project reaffirmed my commitment to purpose-driven personal branding web design.
