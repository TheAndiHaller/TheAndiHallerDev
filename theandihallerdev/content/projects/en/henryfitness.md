### Final group project carried out for the Bootcamp #SoyHenry.

It is an App that seeks to improve the online interaction that a gym has with its customers. Providing all the information about the services it offers, giving the facility to pay memberships online and manage shifts to activities or classes that can be taken from a user profile.

**Front-End:** #React #Redux #css #html #Bootstrap #JWT #NodeMailer #Cloudinary

The backend of the project is deployed on #Heroku and the frontend on #Vercel. Completing this project was a very big challenge and finishing it successfully was only possible thanks to the tremendous team I had to work with.

As a team we used agile methodologies to coordinate tasks and #trello to organize them. Github was another indispensable tool that allowed us to work in parallel more efficiently and orderly.
