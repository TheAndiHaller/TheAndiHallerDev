### Meet Tridibot: The 3D Printed Robot That You Can Control Over Wifi

Have you ever dreamed of having your own robot companion? A robot that can walk and even play soccer? Well, dream no more! In this blog post, I will introduce you to Tridibot, a 3D printed robot that is controlled over wifi from any device. Tridibot is a fun and educational project that anyone can build and customize. Let me tell you how it all started.

### The Origin of Tridibot

Tridibot was born out of a challenge. My friend Konrad and I are both passionate about robotics and 3D printing. We love to tinker with different gadgets and create new things. One day, we were contacted by a teacher from the University of La Punta, who asked us if we could build a robot that could help him in his classroom. He wanted a robot that could interact with his students, teach them some basic concepts of robotics and programming, and also entertain them with some games.

We accepted the challenge and started brainstorming ideas. We decided to make a robot that had four legs instead of wheels because we thought it would be more agile and expressive. We also wanted to make it wireless so that it could be controlled from any device without cables or wires. And we wanted to make it affordable and accessible so that anyone could replicate it with common materials and tools.

We chose to use an ESP8266 and an Arduino nano as the micro-controllers for Tridibot. The ESP8266 is a tiny board that has wifi capabilities and can communicate with any device over the internet. The Arduino nano is a small board that can control servos and sensors. We connected them using serial communication and wrote the code using Arduino IDE.

We wanted Tridibot to be rechargeable so we used a lithium-ion battery pack and a charging module. We also added an on/off switch and an LED RGB ring for feedback.

The best part about Tridibot is that it is open source. That means anyone can download the files, print their own parts, assemble their own robot, and modify it as they wish. We have uploaded all the files on GitHub and Thingiverse along with detailed instructions on how to build your own Tridibot.

Tridibot is more than just a toy. It is a learning platform that can teach you about robotics, electronics, programming, 3D printing, and more. It is also a fun way to interact with your friends or family over wifi. You can control your Tridibot from your phone, tablet, laptop, or any other device that has a web browser.

We are very proud of what we have created and we hope you will enjoy it too. If you want to learn more about Tridibot or build your own please visit the Github repository.

Thank you for reading this blog post and stay tuned for more updates on our project!
